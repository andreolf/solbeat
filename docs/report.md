# Solbeat — State of the Solana Network

> Generated 2026-10-24T21:37:56Z · zero API keys · Python stdlib + public endpoints

## Analyst commentary

Epoch 1067 is 14% complete (~22h remaining), with the cluster processing ~2,160 TPS (2,160 non-vote). Measured slot time is 213ms — live on-chain evidence that SIMD-0525's first slot-time reduction step (350ms target) is active on mainnet. The network earned $689.3K of Real Economic Value over the last 24h ($479/minute), computed as base + priority fees plus Jito MEV tips. SOL trades at $101.31 (-2.3% / 24h). Decentralization: Nakamoto coefficient 18, 665 active validators, 0.1% of stake delinquent. Alpenglow readiness: validators holding 100% of stake have registered BLS keys ahead of the consensus upgrade. Anomaly scan: all clear across every monitored metric.
